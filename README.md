- 💾 Persistent storage using pickle
- 🖥️ Simple menu-driven CLI interface for easy navigation

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

## 📁 Running the Project

After downloading the application, follow these steps to run it on your computer:

1. **Open your terminal or command prompt.**
2. **Navigate to the directory where you saved the application.** Use the following command:

   ```
   cd path/to/your/todo-list
   ```

   Replace `path/to/your/todo-list` with the actual path on your computer.

3. **Run the application using Python.** Enter this command:
